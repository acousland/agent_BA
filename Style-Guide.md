## 🌏 Tone and Theme Prompts

These style prompts can guide colour usage in branding, web, or app design:

### Environmental & Regional Identity Prompt
> Design with the rhythm of land and water — clean blues for trust, natural greens for renewal, and warm earth tones acknowledging Country. Every visual should feel calm, deliberate, and deeply local.

### Innovation & Circular Economy Prompt
> Balance sustainability with modernity: pair deep blues with electric aqua and renewable gold. Use gradient motion lines or circular patterns to symbolise continuous renewal.

### Cultural & Community Prompt
> Integrate warm, earthy reds and subtle ochres alongside natural blues and greens to represent partnership with Traditional Custodians and the shared responsibility for Country.

### Professional & Transparent Prompt
> Maintain clarity and accessibility through strong contrast, open whitespace, and consistent typography. Every element should communicate accountability and care.
